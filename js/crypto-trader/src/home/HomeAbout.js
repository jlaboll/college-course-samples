        <p>
            Developed as a internship-level project during the 2020 pandemic, Practice-Crypto aims to provide easy to
            understand ways to
            practice buying/selling in the volatile cryptocurrency market. By allowing users to "invest" with as much
            seed money as they wish,
            they are welcomed to watch their theoretical investment change in value, and use this as a basis for
            deciding if they are to
            actually invest in cryptocurrency.
